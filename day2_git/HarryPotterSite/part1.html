    <h3></h3>

    <p>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (known as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) is a 2001 fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus and produced by David Heyman from a screenplay by Steve Kloves. It is based on the 1997 novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J. K. Rowling. It is the first instalment in the Harry Potter film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Its story follows Harry's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his formal wizarding education.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros. Pictures bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported £1 million ($1.65 million). Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Columbus being chosen to helm the film from a short list of directors that included Steven Spielberg and Rob Reiner. Rowling insisted that the entire cast be British and Irish, with the three leads chosen in August 2000 following open casting calls. Filming took place at Leavesden Film Studios and historic buildings around the United Kingdom from September 2000 to March 2001.
